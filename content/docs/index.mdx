First off, thank you for using `sshark.app`

## Basic Search

Simply type a username to find their public SSH keys:
```
merlindorin
```

## Field-Specific Search

Use field prefixes to search specific attributes:

- `@username:merlindorin` — Search by username
- `@key:{AAAAC3NzaC1lZD*}` — Reverse lookup by key content
- `@comment:work` — Search in key comments

## Available Fields

### Text Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `@username` | Owner username |
| `@comment` | Key comment |
| `@updated_at` | Last update date |

### Tag Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `@id` | Key identifier (UUID) |
| `@key` | Key content (base64) |
| `@source` | github, gitlab, bitbucket, manual |
| `@type` | ssh-rsa, ssh-ed25519, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 |

## Tag Filters

Filter by source platform or key type:

- `@source:{github}` — Only keys from GitHub
- `@source:{github|gitlab}` — Keys from GitHub or GitLab
- `@type:{ssh-ed25519}` — Only Ed25519 keys

## Advanced Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `merl*` | Wildcard search — matches merlindorin, merlin, etc. |
| `"merlindorin"` | Exact phrase match |
| `%typo%` | Fuzzy search — tolerates typos |

## Reverse Lookup

Have a key and want to find who owns it? Just paste the key content directly in the search box:
```
AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI...
```

Paste any part of the public key to find its owner.
